# PS2-Yabasic-Exploit
PS2 exploit for demo discs containing Yabasic that allows arbitrary code execution.

## How does it work?
A blog post about how this works can be found [here](http://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html).

## Usage
Install the [PS2DEV toolchain](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2toolchain#requirements) (really you just need a MIPS compiler), place your assembly payload in `payloads/name.s` and run `make` to build it into a Yabasic exploit.

On PS2, run the `%lg` patch corresponding to your disc first. EG: for PBPX-95205 that will be in `out/patches-95205.yab`.

Then you can run your payload (located at `out/name.yab`).

If your payload writes a value, you'll need to run the `feEgG` patch, and then you can run the debugger program to print it (both in `out/patches-version.yab`).

## Using strings
If you want to reference a string in your payload, create a corresponding string file (EG: `boot-fifa.s` and `boot-fifa.string`).

The string will be about `0x240` bytes before the payload, depending on its length, so can be referenced by `$a1 - 0x240`. `maker.c` shows how the string length changes the amount of heap space required - it's kind of weird.
